## Steps

1. Sit comfortably and soften the gaze or close your eyes.
2. Take a gentle inhale through the nose; exhale slowly through the mouth.
3. Notice contact points: feet, seat, back. Let them support you fully.
4. If thoughts rise, acknowledge them and return to the breath.
5. After the track ends, jot a few words about what you noticed.

> Tip: If emotions feel intense, open your eyes and connect to a grounding object in the room.
