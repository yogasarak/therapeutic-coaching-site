Sound can be a powerful anchor. This short practice is streamed directly from SoundCloud so you can experience how new external tracks slide into the existing workflow without custom components.

## Listen In

<SoundCloudEmbed
  trackKey="sweetSweetSteep"
  title="Meditation – Sweet Sweet Steep"
/>

## Try This Ritual

1. **Set the scene** – dim the lights, take three steadying breaths.
2. **Press play** – let the guided instructions move at their own pace.
3. **Notice** – simply observe the textures of breath, body, and sound.
4. **Journal** – write one sentence about what softened or opened.

> Tip: Because the track is registered centrally, future meditations can be added by updating a single metadata file—no new components required.

## After You Listen

- Share one insight with a trusted friend.
- Schedule your next session in your calendar.
- If you are creating new client resources, duplicate this file and swap the track key.
